# Learning-Ionic
A repo for future reference to the concepts I learn while following Ionic tutorials.

Ionic is an HTML5 mobile app development framework targeted at building hybrid mobile apps.


Ionic can be used wither by making an IONIC PROJECT using CLI or it can also be used as a CDN in a normal web project.
The IONIC CDN allows us to use all the ionic components in our html file.
Refer to <a href="Budget-Planner(without-angular)"> “Budget-Planner(without-angular)”</a> folder to see how fine CDN works and how responsive it is.
You can play around the code to understand the IONIC COMPONENTS or you can refer to the official well maintained doc <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/components">here</a>.


The Doc contains all the tips, steps and troubleshooting that I went through while I was working on it.
